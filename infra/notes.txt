AKS cluster automatically creates a public IP in the AKS-managed infrastructure resource group (MC_)
and assigns it to the load balancer outbound pool by default.

DNS ZONE (data resource that contains the DNS records for a domain name)
A DNS zone is used to host the DNS records for a particular domain, It also provides DNS name servers to answer DNS queries from the Internet.

AKS control plane (managed by Azure) can communicate with the node pool via  Azure Private Link service in the API server virtual network and a private endpoint that's exposed on the subnet of your AKS cluster.
