* Usage:

```bash
curl https:/127.0.0.1:500 # homepage
curl http:/127.0.0.1:5000/now # USD BTC price
```
## Create Kubernetes cluster in Azure, AWS or GCP, using Pulumi or Terraform:

* Set up a K8S cluster with the latest stable version, with RBAC enabled:
```bash
# To enable RBAC, start the API server with the --authorization-mode flag set to a comma-separated list that includes RBAC; for example:
kube-apiserver --authorization-mode=Example,RBAC  ...

# check if RBAC is enabled for AKS
az aks list -o table
az aks show -g <resource group name> -n <cluster name> --query enableRbac
```

* The Cluster should have 2 services deployed â€“ Service A and Service B:
* Service A is a WebServer written in C#, Go or Python that exposes the following:
  * Current value of Bitcoin in USD (updated every 10 seconds taken from an API on the web, like https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=BTC&tsyms=USD).
  * Average value over the last 10 minutes.
* Service B is a REST API service, that exposes a single controller that responds 200 status code on GET requests.
* Cluster should have NGINX Ingress controller deployed, and corresponding ingress rules for Service A and Service B.
* Service A should not be able to communicate with Service B.
 

## General Guidelines:

* The following cluster buildout should be secure, repeatable, and automated as much as possible.
